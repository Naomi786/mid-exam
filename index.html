        Rolex is currently facing a problem in their brand positioning in the U.S. luxury watch market. In the years following the 2008 recession, Rolex’s competitors Breitling and Omega have outpaced them in market share growth. This report aims to analyze the reasons behind this decline and to provide a recommendation for Rolex to reaffirm position as the market leader.

            Omega (part of the Swatch Group portfolio of brands), was facing a similar demise in the early 1990's and successfully repositioned itself and became a major profit driver for the group. It achieved this by carefully selecting its marketing programs and drastically trimming its product line from 2,500 to 130. This strategy needs to be applied to Swatch, which focuses on the basic and middle-priced market. This is supported by the fact that the number of resellers dropped from 3,000 in the early 1990's to 1,200 in 1998.

            One of the primary change in strategies would require pruning Omega’s product lines to make it more coherent and to eliminate any potential intra-firm competition. Typically, the lower end models need to be pruned so that it could be positioned as a more effective Luxurious Brand to compete directly against other Luxury Brand watches. The prevention of any overlapping with sub-brands will ensure that there is no potential risk to the dilution of brand image as well as reduce the risk of cannibalization of the current product lines.
